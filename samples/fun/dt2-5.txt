Three million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf.  It's
crew, Dave Lister, the last human being alive. Arnold Rimmer, a
hologram of his dead bunkmate, and a creature who evolved from the
ship's cat.  Message ends.

Additional:  Our biggest enemy is going space crazy
through loneliness.  The only thing that helps me maintain my slender
grip on reality is the friendship I share with my collection of singing
potatoes.

[:np]Red Dwarf, Season 2, Episode 5. Queeg.[_<800>]Sleeping quarters.

CAT is on a chair, listening to a personal stereo, LISTER on the bottom
bunk.  RIMMER is playing draughts with a skutter.  LISTER is filling out
a questionnaire in a woman's magazine.

think your boobs are:  A, too small, B, just right or C, too large?"
[:np]He feels one breast. [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Definitely too large!  So what's me rating?
"Mainly sees,  You sure are one foxy lady:  sexy, sensual and you don't
mind showing it." Yee-es!  I'm a sex beast!

 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] Owww!  Isn't this great? Yoooow!

[:np]LISTER takes the tape box from CAT.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]    "Robert Hardy reads "Tess Of The

[:np]He listens for a few seconds, then joins in CAT's ecstatic howls.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   The tape must have got twisted, man!  This is really good!
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] EXCUSE ME. I'm in the middle of a tactical calculation which
could well swing this entire game.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Rimmer, you've lost, man.
 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] It's true.  He has only one piece left, stuck up in one corner
and surrounded by the skutter's double pieces.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] There's plenty of space for manouver.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   You've only got one move you can make and then he zaps you.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Admittedly, at first glance that is indeed the way it looks.
What you're failing to take into consideration is that El Skutto here
has to go back on duty in [:np]Checks his watch.   [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]4 minutes and 31
seconds.  And if he goes before the game is concluded, I win by

[:np]The skutter gives him the two-fingered salute.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   You're a piece of dirty filthy cheating scum, aren't you?
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Absolutement!  And that is why I'll win. Because I have the
ability to think my way round problems rather than sticking to the
straight, pre- programmed lines.  That's why men are so better than
machines.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Oh, I don't know, you know.  I had this Geography teacher, Miss
Foster.  She took us on a school summer camp trip to Deganwy.  I had
the tent next to hers, right.  And in the middle of the night I was
woken up by this really weird noise.  _She_ didn't think men were
better than machines.

[:np :ra240]He is proved to be as wrong as ever when the whole ship shakes under a
tremendous impact.  Everything is thrown sideways, LISTER falls out of
bed, CAT is knocked off his stool, and the table and draught-board go
flying.  Star Trek eat your heart out!

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    That's it, yeah.  Look out, a meteor is about to hit the ship.  I

[_<800>]
[:np]Floor 591.

Enter our intrepid damage-repair squad, accompanied by HOLLY, who has
rigged up a mobile monitor on a trolley.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Well, there's nothing here.  Let's check 592.

my waist where I normally keep them.

[:np]They are indeed absent without notice.  RIMMER is now cut off short at
the waist, like a scene from an old Tex Avery cartoon.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Holly, what's happened to Rimmer's legs?
 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] Here they are right here!

[:np]He sounds disgusted.  The disembodied legs are running around,
desperately trying to find RIMMER.  They are about to go through a door.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Stop them!
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Come on, leggies, this way!  Over here.
 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    It must have been 592.  That's where the Hologram Simulation Suite
is!

[:ra245][:np]RIMMER manages to center his legs under his body, and holds firmly onto
his belt to stop them wandering off again.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] What does this mean?
 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    It's probably not serious, don't panic.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Well, when it's not serious when your genitals can go wandering
off on their own, I wonder what is?

[:np]They head for one of the lifts.  RIMMER pauses to make sure his legs are
fully attached, then hurries to catch up.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Wait for me me me me me me me!
[_<800>]

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Rimmer, are you alright?

[:np]RIMMER comes round the corner.  he is moving with a strange, skipping
step.  In reply to LISTER's question, he clasps his hands together, and
speaks in a high- pitched lilting falsetto:

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 300 pr 95] [:ra 220] Well, you see, the shuttle was late, the shuttle was late.  And
they're usually so good, they're so good, aren't they?
 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] What's happened to him?
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   He's turned into Brannigan, the ship's psychiatrist.
 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    We'd better get him fixed.

[:np]Inside, it is a mess.  Alarms sound, warning lights flash and smoke fills
the air.  LISTER and CAT grab fire extinguishers and start to tackle the
fires from burning consoles.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    It's all in hand.  No panic.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    Bypass the main circuit.  That ring of switches over there.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 pr 0] [:ra 220] Now press the bypass.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Ugh!  That was horrible.  I never want to go through that again!

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    It's a loose cable.  Put the red plug in the blue socket.

[:np]RIMMER snaps back to normal.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Is that it over?  Are we okay now?
 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    Yes.

[:np]LISTER holds up a yellow leed.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Shouldn't this plug into something?

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    Yeah.

[:np]LISTER picks up the cable in question and joins the two together.  There
is a blue crackling flash as LISTER is given the shock of his life.  The
connection holds for a few seconds before being blown apart by an
explosion.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    or is it the yellow cable?  Yes, it should have been the yellow
cable.

[:np]The others pick themselves up from the floor.  RIMMER is shaking with
rage.  He addresses HOLLY.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] You are a total, total [_<600>] a word has yet to be invented to

 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] Hey, who's that?

large ears.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Aliens!

[:np]He goes and bows down in front of the monitor.  HOLLY's reaction is
somewhat different.  He seems uncomfortable.  it is clear that he
recognises this face, and is expecting trouble.

computer to replace the primary computer, if the primary computer

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Feels?  He never feels anything, Lister.  He's a computer.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   He still feels.  In fact, sometimes i think it's cruel giving
machines a personality.  My mate Petersen once brought a pair of shoes
with artificial intelligence.  Smart Shoes, they were called.  It was a
neat idea.  No matter how blind drunk you were, they would always get
you home.  Then he got ratted one night in Oslo, and woke up the next
morning in Burma.  See, the shoes got bored just going from his local
to the flat.  They wanted to see the world, man, y'no?  He had a
helluva job getting rid of them.  No matter who he sold them to, they'd
show up again the next day!  He tried to shut them out, but they just
kicked the door down, y'no?
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Is this true?
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Yeah!  Last thing he heard, they'd sort of, erm, robbed a car and
drove it into a canal.  They couldn't steer, y'see.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Really!
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Yeah.  Petersen was really, really blown away by it.  He went to
see a priest.  The priest told him, he said, it was alright, and all
that, and the shoes were happy, and they'd gone to heaven.  Y'see, it
turns out shoes have soles.

[:np]While RIMMER is thinking about this, LISTER makes his getaway.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Well, what a sad, sad story.

[:np]He thinks about it, then a look of puzzlement spreads across his face.

[:np]Sleeping quarters. Morning.

LISTER and RIMMER are in their bunks.  On the bedside table, the numbers
on the antique 20th century radio/clock flick from 5:59 am to 6:00 am.
Abruptly, the alarm sounds.  RIMMER bounces out of bed, shouting
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Off!
[:np]He makes it out into the corridor before visual input from his eyes
reaches his brain.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Uh, Queeg?  Why has my alarm clock gone off at six o'clock?
[:nd] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220] That's the time you asked for.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Ah, now, Holly and I had this little understanding.  I Would say
"Holly, wake me up at six o'clock without fail," then Holly would
pretend to forget, and wake me up around ten with breakfast.  OK?

[:np]Satisfied that his wishes have been made known, RIMMER goes back to bed.
A few seconds later, the alarm goes off again.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Off!

[:np]He sits up on his bunk, and regards QUEEG thoughtfully.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Queeg, I can see we've already cultivated a special

[:nd] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220] MOVE IT, BOY!

[:np]RIMMER's arms and legs, quite without consultation with RIMMER, begin to
exercise healthily.  RIMMER squeaks in terror.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] What are you doing!
[:nd] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220] What I'm doing, pilgrim, is I'm taking you for the regulation five

[:np]Red Dwarf corridor.

CAT is at a wall-mounted vending machine, trying to get something to eat.
RIMMER is jogged past.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] I want control of my own body!  Getting fit is going

[:np]No response.
[_<800>][:np]Sleeping quarters.

LISTER is shaving, with his usual complete lack of charm.  RIMMER is
entered.  His head is lolling at an angle and his eyes are closed.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   What's the matter with him?
[:nd] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220] He fainted after the first 500 yards.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   What, you made him jog two and a half miles unconscious?

[:np]RIMMER's head is lifted, and his face slapped several times to wake him
up.

[:nd] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220] Revise and learn pages 21 to 25.  You will then be tested.  If you

[:np]As RIMMER collapses on the bunk, CAT enters.

 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] Hey, I can't get any food!
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Try a different machine.

They are, needless to say, working.  To be precise, scrubbing the decks.

 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] I can't believe I'm doo'in this!  Look at me, I'm disgusting!  I look

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Look, it's easy.  Keep imagining the floor as Queeg's face.

[:np]They look at the floor, spit at it in unision and rub hard at it with the
brushes.  After a few seconds, though, CAT pauses again.

 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] Aw, look at my hands!  I had lovely hands!
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Well, wear the smegging gloves!

cat[_<300>]I need some naps.  If I don't nap nine or ten times a day, I
don't have enough energy for my main snooze.

[:np]Just then, HOLLY approaches from a side-corridor.  He is on a monitor
which is mounted on a trolley.  He is wearing a hat.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    Halt!  Who goes there [_<300>] friend or foe?

[:np]CAT sprays HOLLY's monitor screen with window clener, then bufs it with a

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Well, I defended you.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   No.  That was Rimmer!
 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    Nevertheless.  The fact remains that there are certain characters

[:np]HOLLY pauses.  He lifts a book into view -- a large yellow book with THE
JUNIOR COLOUR ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SPACE written on the front cover.  It
looks like the sort of science book published in the 1970s.  He takes a

[:np]He rolls off, whistling.  LISTER and CAT, also whistling, get back to
work.
[_<800>]
Rimmer is sitting on his bunk, although judging by his posture, only just.
LISTER is sitting at the table, a food tray in front of him.  He lifts
the lid, then stares.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   He's taking the smeg!

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Queeg.  Look at what he's given me for dinner:  a pea on toast.
One pea.  I tell you, I'm that far from cracking.  [:np]Goes to squish the pea, it snaps away. [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]    I've lost me pea!  Oh, that's it!  I've cracked.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Is he?  Well, I want me pea back.  It's my pea.  I earned that
pea!  Where is it?  I don't care if it's on the floor, if it's covered
in fluff, even under the bed with my toenail clippings, I don't care
where it is -- it's my pea, I earned it, I'm going to eat it no matter
what!
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] It flew off into your dirty-sock basket.
[:np]LISTER pauses to consider this.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   I'll just have the toast.
[:np]He nibbles on one corner of the toast thoughtfully.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   What about trust?  What about fidelity?  What about simple, basic

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Friendship?  Do you know how many people I've met in my life I
could count on as friends?  True friends?
[:np]RIMMER stands up and walks over to the table.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Well, if you count Inflatable Ingrid, your Polythene Pal, one.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] I'll tell you. [:np]He pauses and thinks. [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] None.  I
got burned once, and I learned my lesson.  Don't trust anybody.  There
was this one lad.  Porky Roebuck.  I'd known him two years.  We were
almost family.  His dad was secretely knocking off my mum, that's how
close we were.  Anyway, we were in the Space Scouts together.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   You were in the Space Scouts?
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Oh, yeah.  [:np] He does the Space Scout Salute. [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] "Pinkles, Squirmy.
Flib Flab Flubber." We were fifteen years old.  We went on this
survival course, twenty-four hours out in the wilds, sleeping rough,
surviving on wild berries and things.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   What, did you go to Butlins?
[:np]RIMMER lies down on his bunk.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] We were each given a swiss army knife.  You only ate what you
killed yourself.  I remember ten of the boys got together and decided
to eat me.  They tied me to a stake, lit a fire, and poured barbecue
sauce all over me.  I remember thinking as I went round and round,
"Porky will save me, he's my best friend." It turned out Porky was the
ringleader and had actually bagsied my right buttock.  If it hadn't
been for Yakka-Takka-Tulla, the Space Mistress, I honestly believe they
would have eaten me.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Oh, come on, they were only bullying you.  They would really have
eaten you!  You know what kids are like!
[:np]LISTER flops onto his bunk.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] the point is, Lister, friends are only friends when it suits
them.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  Oh, lights.
[:np]The lights go down.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] Lister?  How did you know about Inflatable Ingrid?
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   I've been seeing her behind your back.

[:np]HOLLY strides (well, wheels) along a corridor.  Over, we hear a tune
playing. It is the tune of a song. The words are:

Do not forsake me, oh my love, I only go, I must be brave:  For I must
face the man who hates me, Or I will cower in my grave.

[:np]HOLLY disappears from the monitor trolley and appears on the main screen,
facing QUEEG.  On another screen, a 3-D chess board appears.
 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Holly, don't do this, man.  You're going to get rubbed.

[:np]The game starts again in earnest.  We see a succession of images crossing
the screen -- QUEEG and HOLLY, as they battle back and forth; the chess
board, peices moving rapidly from square to square, LISTER, CAT and
RIMMER as they watch the battle's progress:  they all look sick to the
stomach.

Sleeping quarters.

CAT, LISTER and RIMMER are gathered there.  CAT and LISTER are on the top
bunk, RIMMER on the bottom.  They all look thoroughly depressed.
 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220] What kind of a plan was that?
 [:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] A stupid plan, that's what kind of plan it was.

Holly, and think "Things weren't too bad when he was around.  Perhaps
not the most efficient computer ever invented, but we had a giggle."

[:np]As he sings the last line his voice, and his image, grows fainter.  The
word "ERASE" Appear on the moniter.  HOLLY vanishes completely, and the
message changes to "ERASE COMPLETED." After a few seconds, QUEEG appears
on the monitor.

[:nd] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220] Okay, suckers, get this into your stupid thick heads.  There's

[:np]The others stare at the moniter in astonishment.  That was HOLLY's voice!
The image on the screen changes -- QUEEG's face fades out, to be replaced
by HOLLY.  He is smiling smugly.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]    We are talking Jape of the Decade.  We are talking April, May,
