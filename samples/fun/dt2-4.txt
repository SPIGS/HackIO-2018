Additional: On our journey back to Earth, we have  encountered many strange and bizarre things. Only last month we came  across a moon which was shaped exactly like Felicity Kendall's bottom.  We flew around that one a couple of times.

Having consumed this repast, second  technician Rimmer, Arnold J. experienced what can only be described as a  voyage to trip-out city. To whit, a major hallucinogenic fit.

Under the influence of this  psychadelic breakfast he went on to attack two senior officers, beleiving them to be giraffes who were armed and dangerous.

A hologrammatic head rises out of the floor;  Rimmer's, with a silver "H" on the forehead. Arnold, understandably, jumps. ]

Back to the present, in the self-same bunk room: Lister is sitting at the table, reading. Cat is on the top bunk, sewing. Rimmer enters.

You will be going down two thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven floors and, for a small extra charge, you can enjoy the in-lift movie "Gone With the Wind. If you look to your right and to your left, you will notice there are no exits. In the highly unlikely event of the lift having to make a crash-landing, death is certain. Under your seats you will find a cassette for recording your last-minute testament, and from above your head a bag will drop containing sedatives and cyanide capsules.

Three hours later, the doors open at floor sixteen. Lister emerges, followed by Rimmer and Cat. They all appear to be suffering from extreme lift-lag. Cat looks the worst: he reels out of the lift, clutching his stomach. ]

It's a blue, glowing hole in the wall, wreathed in white smoke. Cautiously, Lister sticks his hand into it. His hand vanishes. He pulls it back,  it emerges intact. he looks at the others.

He steps through the hole. 
He emerges in the men's shower room on the other side of the wall, but three million years in the past. A digital clock above the wall mirrors gives the date as being 22nd March 2077. He steps back through the hole before any of the men shaving at the mirror can see him. He beckons to Rimmer and Cat.

Not so much as a lump in your throat? No, you're thinking of Kochanski. The only  lump you've got is up the front of your trousers. 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  I'm going for it, Rimmer. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that  you don't get many shots at happiness. So when you do, go for them all.

[:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]Everything always goes wrong for me. I'm probably the only  person in the world to buy a Topic Bar without a single hazelnut in it. 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  It happens, you know, Rimmer. You meet people, then you move on, man. When I was ten, I had a friend called Duncan. Me best mate ever. He taught me everything. He was the one who showed me how to put mirrors on me toecaps so I could look up girl's skirts. Then his father had to move to Spain because of a job. It was a bank job he pulled in Purley. Never saw him again. I still think of him, though[_<800>] every time I look at me shoes. 
[:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]  Don't try and explain it, Lister. I don't know why I'm even  surprised. Everyone always leaves me in the end. Girls, parents [_<400>] 
I had a pet lemming once. I loved that little lemming. I built him a little wall so he could hurl himself over it. He didn't want for anything. I'll never forget one Christmas I put my finger in his cage to give him some mince pie. He bit me! He sunk his teeth right into my fingers and wouldn't let go. In the end I had to smash his brains out against the wall. That little lemming broke my heart. The little [giht] completely ruined my helicopter wallpaper. 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  You know, maybe there is a way to bring people back from the past.

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  Well, there's a spare stasis booth, isn't there? We could bring one person back if we could persuade them to go into suspended animation. 
[:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]  They'd survive the accident.

[:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]  Brilliant! I could save my own life! I wouldn't be dead! 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  Just think: I could bring her back!

[:np] [:ra 245]
Lister breathes on the face of his watch and buffs it on his sleeve. Then, he speaks to it.

They step through the leak.

Lister arrives first. There is a man in the shower, who looks rather surprised at being interrupted. Lister improvises: 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  Excuse me, did you order a kissogram? 
[:np] [:ra 245]

The docking port corridor. Two ladies with haavy suitcases have just been targeted by Olaf Petersen, Lister's long-time drinking buddy and Arnie Shwarzenegger look-alike. He approaches them from behind. 
[:nh]   Felicitations, beautiful ladies. Back from planet-leave? Let me take those heavy cases. My name is Olaf Petersen. I am very good in bed.

As Olaf picks up the suitcases, Lister and Cat emerge from a nearby lift.

Just then Lister spots Petersen whom he hasn't seen for two years  and rushes to greet him.

Lister and Cat head off down the corridor.

Kochanski's quarters. Her room-mate opens the door, to find Lister and Cat outside. 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  Hi. Is Kristine in? 
[:nu] No, she's still on planet-leave.

[:np] [:ra 245]
He dashes off. Cat grins at Krissie's room-mate, trying to think of a decent chat-up line: this, after all, is the first woman he has ever come face to face with. Lister interrupts his ruminations, first with a come-hither gesture then, when that doesn't work, by yanking Cat out of the doorway after him. 
[_<800>]
[:np] [:ra 245]

The foyer of the Ganymede Holiday Inn. Plush, sumptuous and elegant. Lister and Cat approach the main desk. As Lister makes enquiries, Cat wanders off, staring at the sights in this strange building. A suitcase on wheels approaches him from behind. 
 
[:nh] [:dv ap 50]
 Excuse me. 
[:np] [:ra 245]
Cat looks around, bewildered. 
[:nh] [:dv ap 50]
 No, no. Down here. 
[:np] [:ra 245]
Cat looks down. 
[:nh] [:dv ap 50]
 Have you seen a man who's lost his luggage, about 5 foot 10, mousy hair? 
[:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] [:ra 250]  No, I haven't. 
[:nh] [:dv ap 50]
Oh, no. I bet they've sent him to the wrong bloody airport again! 
[:np] [:ra 245]
Cat stares as the suitcase rolls away. So distracted is he, he bumps into a lady wearing a fox fur. Cat, seeing the fur, reacts instantly: 
[:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] [:ra 250]  Aaargh! Dog! And he's trying to strangle that woman! 
[:np] [:ra 245]
Cat grabs a spray-bottle of mineral water from a passing robot waiter, and starts attacking the fox fur. The flabbergasted woman, believing herself to be under attack by a (tastefully dressed) madman, flees. Cat shakes the piece of fur by the throat, then jumps up and down on it. 
[:np] [:dv sm 1 hs 90  br 0 ri 0 la 0] [:ra 250]  Don't worry, madam.  his strangling days are over! 
[:np] [:ra 245]
Just then Lister arrives, holding a piece of paper with Kochanski's room number on it. 
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  Cat, I've got it. C'mon. Room 008. This way! 
[_<800>]
[:np] [:ra 245]

Outside Kochanski's room. Lister stops, stunned, staring at the flowers, the "Do Not Disturb" sign, the plaque on the door;  "Honeymoon Suite, the two pairs of shoes outside the door[_<600>] 
The evidence is incontrivertible.

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  What about the photograph? 
[:np] [:ra 245]
He pulls it out and examines it again.

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]  I'm not the groom. He

I mean, natural yoghurt eaters! Reliable, sensible, dependable, and lots of  other words that end in ibble. He's obsessed with house-prices, and spends half his life in antique fairs looking for bargains and drinking wine. It's never beer, is it, it's always wine! [_<400>]
What do you want on your cornflakes, darling? Oh, I'll have some wine, please! Smeg! 
[:np] [:ra 245]
He leans against a wall, bitter and angry. Cat taps him on one shoulder.

Just then, the door to the Honeymoon Suite opens and Kochanski steps out. 
[:nb]   Oh, hi. It's you.

[:np] [:ra 245]
Just then, the door to the shower opens and out steps[_<400>] 
Lister. Older, bearded as in the photo, wearing a bathrobe, he greets his younger self with a grin.

He grabs Lister and Cat and herds them towards the door. Lister stops him at the door and leans on the door jamb.

He half shoves lister and Cat out the door, then leans on it and grins at his bride.

Cat holds up a pilferred bottle of wine. They both grin soundlessly.

The Sleeping Quarters. An orderly wheels in Rimmer, who is strapped into a wheelchair and dressed in hospital clothing, a thin gown, socks and a plastic cap. Lister, still dressed in his space-suit, is fast asleep on his bunk.

The orderly unstraps Rimmer from the chair, then helps him over to his bed. 
[:nr] 
 If you need anything, Call Holly.

The orderly leaves. Rimmer sits on the edge of his bunk, thoroughly depressed. What's about to happen will not alleviate this state.
