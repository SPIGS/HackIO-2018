This is the complete total of all DECtalk examples I have.
The files ending in .DEC are asky text files, open them as you would.
note: many of these are written by people i've never heard of, many more written by people i'd love to contact.

If you go out of this directory and back to the main, you will find a file called dectalk43.zip
This is the DECtalk software demo v 4.3.
