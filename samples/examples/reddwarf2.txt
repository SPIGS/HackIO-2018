an S O S distress call from
the mining ship Red Dwarf.  The crew are dead, killed by a radiation
leak.  The only survivors are Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation
during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in
the hold.  Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions
are a life form who evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
simulation of one of the dead crew.  I am Holly, the ship's computer,

We're going to hit lightspeed in 24 hours.  I

Lister and Rimmer's cabin.  Lister is taking stuff out of his locker
and packing it in a box.  The Cat is eating, and looking at Lister's
slide collection on a wall monitor.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Ah, now

played with the London Jets zero gravity football team.  He was roof

In the picture, Lister is grinning like a maniac

  Changing pictures, to one of an ugly individual

nutted the headmaster when I came bottom in French.

He Goes to

Spins round and looks cautiously

Lister notices something wrong in his goldfish tank.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Oh,
Lennon.  Look what's happened to Mccartney.

[:np] [:ra 245]
He goes over to the tank and grabs one of the fish.  He holds up
to his ear and shakes it, then bangs it on the table a couple of times
and listens to it again.  Finally he uses a screwdriver to pry it
open (we now see that it's mechanical) and make some hamfisted adjustments.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Solid

Perfection!  And
they said you was a waste of money.

[:np] [:ra 245]
Rimmer enters.  The cat follows him in and walks around him, staring
at his ridiculous hair cut.  Lister is busy packing and doesn't notice.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   What's he
looking at?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Who?

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Holly did it.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Why?

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Because I
ordered him to.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   It
looks ridiculous.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   It may look
ridiculous to you, Lister, but I
like it like this. It makes me feel like a man.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Yeah,
and you'll probably get one, looking like
that.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   There's
nothing wrong with short hair, Lister.  It
gives a man a sense of dignity, a sense of discipline.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Rimmer,
have you seen it?

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   I don't need
to see it.  I didn't get this hair cut

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Well,
Holly said to go into it while we went

Why should I mind?  Three hundred

used to.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   That's what

you pick?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   It

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Oh, yes, I

External shot of the ship, then cut to Lister in their cabin.  He's
freshening himself up, which for Lister means reaching under his T-shirt
to scratch with one hand and spray under his arms with the other.

He suddenly realises that he's spraying his face with underarm deodorant.
Cautiously reaching under his shirt, he discovers that he's been spraying
shaving foam under his arms.  He scrapes off a handful and slaps it
on his face.

Cut to the ship in space, although we can still hear Lister's singing
in the background.  Suddenly there's a loud `bang' and everything
changes colour to a red blur on white space.

Cut back to the cabin; the colour distortion is still there, but
quickly fades back to normal.  Lister looks around wildly in surprise.

again.

He suddenly realises that his image in the mirror isn't following
his movements properly.  He stops and stares at it; his image continues
shaving.  After a moment he turns away, and doesn't notice that his
reflection has cut its chin.

As he turns back to the mirror, his reflection turns away and shouts
something.  Rimmer comes running up behind it.  The real Lister whirls
around, but Rimmer isn't there on his side of the mirror.  Eventually
he turns back to the mirror, where Lister and Rimmer are holding a
conversation.  The real Lister starts shaving again, keeping a close
watch on the mirror.

Rimmer walks into the middle of the room, and Lister realises that
Rimmer isn't looking at him, but at an empty spot in the air.  Throughout
the following conversation, Rimmer continues ignoring Lister and talking
to thin air, while Lister is continually looking around, trying to
figure out what Rimmer thinks he's talking to.

A corridor.  Lister runs into two of the Skutters; one is holding
a piece of paper in its claws.

The Skutters begin banging their heads on the wall.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   I mean,
there's nothing for me here.  I want

[:np] [:ra 245]
Suddenly there's the sound of an explosion.  The corridor shakes,
and Lister falls over.

Rimmer begins humming the Dead March and miming carrying a coffin.

Just as he's about to bite down on it, Lister dashes into the room,
knocks the fish sandwich out of his hand, and wrestles him down onto
the table. The Cat's head is knocked against one corner.

[:np] [:ra 245]
lister picks up the fish, overjoyed.  [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] I got the

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Absolutely,

Lister walks down a corridor, brandishing the pipe and looking determined.

Drive room (bridge).  Lister cautiously peers around the doorway.  There
is a menacing hum in the background.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]   I'm
afraid it can't cope with the influx of data

me?

[:np] [:ra 245]
Lister picks up a small computer and carries it over to the main
console, which is malfunctioning badly, spitting out showers of sparks.  He
cautiously plugs it in, then closes his eyes and starts flipping switches.
The background hum gets louder and higher pitched (and Lister screws
his face up a bit more) with each switch.

He flips the last switch.  The noise and sparks stop.  Everything
returns to normal.  Lister gradually realises this and grins with
relief.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Maybe
it's not going to happen at all!

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   It was you!  I
saw you.  I'm sure it was you.

[:np] [:ra 245]
Suddenly they both notice that Lister's bunk is occupied.  It's an
old man, recognisably an aged version of Lister.  His right arm is
mechanical; his left hand holds a bottle of beer.

>[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]
[:tone<1000,75>] Hello, Dave.  This is me.  I mean you.  I mean,
I am you.  This is you aged 171, Dave.  [:np] [:ra 245]
Uses his bionic hand to pop
the cap off the bottle.
[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] I know
you're there, because when I was your
age, I saw me at my age telling you what I'm about to tell you.  You've
got to tell you when you get to be me.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Thank heavens
you've still got all your marbles,
Lister.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]
[sh<400>!]

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]
[:tone<1000,75>] I've got to tell you about Bexley.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Who's Bexley?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   I was
always going to call my second son Bexley,
after Jim Bexley Speed.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Your second
son?  What were you going to call
your first son?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Jim.
After Jim Bexley Speed.

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]
[:tone<1000,75>]  It wasn't you Rimmer saw in the drive room, it
was Bexley.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Rimmer,
you saw me son die!

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Never mind
this tot, what about me, old man?  What
happens to me? Do I become an officer?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Rimmer,
I'm going to have two sons!  Isn't it
fantastic?

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   But one of
them dies.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Yeah,
well, everyone dies.  You're born, and
you die.  The bit in the middle's called life, and that's still to
come!

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]
[:tone<1000,75>]  Go and get your camera.  You haven't got much time.  Get
your camera and run to the medical unit.  Run!

[:np] [:ra 245]
Lister hastily rummages around in his junk for the camera.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   What about me?
What happens to me?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   He
can't hear us, Rimmer.  He's from the future.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Ah, but if I
ask you now, you can remember it,
and when you get to be him, you can tell me.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Boss
thinking.

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] [:tone<1000,75>] Rimmer.  You wanted to know what happened to you?

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Yes!

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] [:tone<1000,75>] Well, come closer.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Yes!

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] [:tone<1000,75>] Come closer still.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Yes!

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] [:tone<1000,75>] Closer still.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Yes!

[:np] [:ra 245]
Lister 2 suddenly laughs and vanishes.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   You goit!
[:np] [:ra 245]
Turns to the original Lister.
[:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]  No,
*you* goit!

[:np] [:ra 245]
Lister runs off.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   You're all
goits!  I'm surrounded by goits!  Holly,
you're a goit!

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]   I'm a
what?

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   You heard.

[_<800>]
[:np] [:ra 245]
Cut to a corridor, just outside the medical unit.  Lister is fiddling
with his camera.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   What's
happening, Hol?  Are we going to see my
funeral or something?

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]   Look,
the faster we go, the more into the future
the future echoes are.  And now, since we've just started to slow
down, the future echoes are nearer to the present.  Clear?

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   No.

 [:np] [:dv as 0 bf 0 la 20 nf 00 ri 100 sm 0 hr 0 sr 0] [:ra 220]   Tough.

[:np] [:ra 245]
Rimmer arrives.  He has another ridiculous hair cut.  This time he
looks like one of the Monkees.

 [:nf] [:dv br 0 la 0 sr 100 hr 100 ap 150 pr 95] [:ra 220]   Wait a minute.
I don't understand how you're
supposed to get two sons without a woman on this ship.

 [:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30]   Neither
do I.  But it's going to be a laugh finding
out.

[:np] [:ra 245]
The door to the medical unit slides open, and another Lister (not
noticeably older than the `real' one) walks out, carrying two crying
babies.

[:nf] [:ra 240] [:dv br 0 hs 95 ap 100 as 100 pr 220 hr 30 sr 30] [:tone<1000,75>] [:tone<1000,75>] I can't see you, but I know you can see
me.  I'd
like you to meet your two sons.  This is Jim, and this is Bexley.  Oh,
stop crying and say cheese, boys!

[:np] [:ra 245]
Lister 3 grins for the camera, and Lister 1 snaps the photo.  Cut
to a close-up of the photo against a backdrop of stars.
