      The Story of Little Black Sambo.
      by Helen Bannerman .
Once upon a time there was a little black boy, and his name was Little 
Black Sambo. 
[:nr]
And his mother was called Black Mumbo.
[:nh :dv hs 120]
And his father was called Black Jumbo.
[:np]
And Black Mumbo made him a beautiful little Red Coat, and a pair of
beautiful little blue trousers. 
And Black Jumbo went to the Bazaar, and bought him a beautiful Green 
Umbrella, and a lovely little Pair of Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles 
and Crimson Linings. 
And then wasn't Little Black Sambo grand? 
So he put on all his Fine Clothes, and went out for a walk in the 
Jungle. And by and by he met a Tiger. And the Tiger said to him,
[:nh :dv la 110 hs 110]
"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!"
[:np]
And Little Black Sambo said,
[:nh :dv hs 40]
"Oh! Please Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and I'll give you my beautiful little
Red Coat."
[:np]
So the Tiger said,
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 110]
"Very well, I won't eat you this time, but
you must give me your beautiful little Red Coat."
[:np]
So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Red Coat, and went away saying,
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 110]
"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle."
[:np]
And Little Black Sambo went on, and by and by he met another Tiger, and
it said to him,
[:nh :dv la 110 hs 120]
"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!"
[:np]
And Little Black Sambo said,
[:nh :dv hs 40]
"Oh! Please Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and
I'll give you my beautiful little Blue Trousers."
[:np]
So the Tiger said,
[:nh :dv la 110 hs 120]
"Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must give me your
beautiful little Blue Trousers."
[:np]
So the Tiger got poor Little Black
Sambo's beautiful little Blue Trousers, and went away saying,
[:nh :dv la 110 hs 120]
"Now I'M the grandest Tiger in the Jungle." 
[:np]
And Little Black Sambo went on, and by and by he met another Tiger, and
it said to him,
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120]
"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!"
[:np]
And Little Black Sambo said:
[:nh :dv hs 40]
 "Oh! Please Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and
I'll give you my beautiful little Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles and 
Crimson Linings." 
[:np]
But the Tiger said:
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120]
"What use would your shoes be to me? I've got four
feet, and you've got only two; you haven't got enough shoes for me." 
[:np]
But Little Black Sambo said:
[:nh :dv hs 40] "You could wear them on your ears."
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120]
"So I could,"
[:np] said the Tiger:
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120]
"that's a very good idea. Give them to me,
and I won't eat you this time." 
[:np]
So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Purple Shoes
with Crimson Soles and Crimson Linings, and went away saying,
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120]
"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle." 
[:np]
And by and by Little Black Sambo met another Tiger, and it said to him,
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 100]
"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!"
[:np] And Little Black Sambo
said:
[:nh :dv hs 40] "Oh! Please Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and I'll give you my
beautiful Green Umbrella."
[:np] But the Tiger said:
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 100]
"How can I carry an umbrella, when I need all my paws for walking with?" 
[:nh :dv hs 40]
"You could tie a knot on your tail and carry it that way,"
[:np]
said Little Black Sambo.
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 100]
"So I could,"
[:np]
said the Tiger.
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 100]
" Give it to me, and I won't eat you this time."
[:np]
So he got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful Green
Umbrella, and went away saying,
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 100]
"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the
Jungle." 
[:np]
And poor Little Black Sambo went away crying, because the cruel Tigers
had taken all his fine clothes. 
[:nh :dv hs 20] [:phone arpa on] [buw<300>.hxuw<400>hxuw<300>]
[:np] Presently he heard a horrible noise that sounded like
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120] [:phone arpa on][grr<500>]
[:np]
and it got louder and louder.
[:nh :dv hs 40]
"Oh! dear!"
[:np]
said Little Black Sambo:
[:nh :dv hs 40]
 "there are all the Tigers coming back to eat me up! What shall I
do?"
[:np]
So he ran quickly to a palm tree, and peeped round it to see what
the matter was. 
And there he saw all the Tigers fighting, and disputing which of them 
was the grandest. And at last they all got so angry that they jumped up 
and took off all the fine clothes, and began to tear each other with 
their claws, and bite each other with their great big white teeth. 
And they came, rolling and tumbling right to the foot of the very tree 
where Little Black Sambo was hiding, but he jumped quickly in behind the 
umbrella. And the Tigers all caught hold of each other's tails, as they 
wrangled and scrambled, and so they found themselves in a ring round the 
tree. 
Then, when the Tigers were very wee and very far away, Little Black 
Sambo jumped up, and called out:
[:nh :dv hs 40]
 "Oh! Tigers! why have you taken off all your nice clothes? Don't you want them any more?"
 [:np] But the Tigers only
answered:
[:nh :dv la 140 hs 120] [:phone arpa on][grr<500>]
[:np]
Then Little Black Sambo said:
[:nh :dv hs 40]
 "If you want them, say so, or I'll take
them away."  [:np] But the Tigers would not let go of each other's tails, and 
so they could only say, [:nh :dv la 130 hs 110] [:phone arpa on][grr<600>].
[:np]
So Little Black Sambo put on all his fine clothes again and walked off.
And the Tigers were very, very angry, but still they would not let go of 
each other's tails. And they were so angry, that they ran round the 
tree, trying to eat each other up, and they ran faster and faster, till 
they were whirling round so fast that you couldn't see their legs at 
all. 
And they still ran faster and faster and faster, till they all just 
melted away, and there was nothing left but a great big pool of melted 
butter (or "ghi," as it is called in India) round the foot of the tree. 
Now Black Jumbo was just coming home from his work, with a great big 
brass pot in his arms, and when he saw what was left of all the Tigers 
he said,
      [:nh :dv hs 120]
"Oh! what lovely melted butter! I'll take that home to Black
Mumbo for her to cook with." 
[:np]
So he put it all into the great big brass pot, and took it home to Black
Mumbo to cook with. 
When Black Mumbo saw the melted butter, wasn't she pleased!
[:nr] "Now,"
[:np] said she:
[:nr]
"we'll all have pancakes for supper!"
[:np]
So she got flour and eggs and milk and sugar and butter, and she made a
huge big plate of most lovely pancakes. And she fried them in the melted 
butter which the Tigers had made, and they were just as yellow and brown 
as little Tigers. 
And then they all sat down to supper. And Black Mumbo ate Twenty-seven 
pancakes, and Black Jumbo ate Fifty-five but Little Black Sambo ate a 
Hundred and Sixty-nine, because he was so hungry.
