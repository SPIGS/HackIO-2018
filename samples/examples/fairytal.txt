A California Shaggy Bear Tale for Seven DECtalk Voices.
By Dennis Klatt.
[:nh]  This  story was used to demonstrate DECtalk at ['aykaesp]
84,  in May of 1984, at San Diego California.
[:np]  Once upon a time, there were three bears. They  lived  in
the  great forest and tried to adjust to modern times.
[:nh] I'm papa bear. I love my family, but I love ["]honey best.
[:nb] I'm mama bear. Being a mama bear is a drag.
[:nk]  I'm baby bear and I have trouble relating to all  of  the
demands of older bears.
[:np]  One  day,  the three bears [)] left their condominium  to
search  for honey. While they were gone, a beautiful young  lady
snuck into the bedroom through an open window.
[:nw]  My name is Whispering Wendy. My purpose in entering  this
building  should  be clear. I am planning to  steal  the  family
jewels.
[:np]  [+]  Hot  on  her trail was the famous police  detective,
Frail  Frank.
[:nf]  Have  you  seen a lady carrying a laundry  bag  over  her
shoulder?
[:np]  A woman, kneeling with her left ear firmly placed against
a  large rock, responded.
[:nu]  ["]No. No [/]one passed this [/\]way. I've been listening
for  ["]earthquakes  all morning, but have  only  spotted  three
bears  searching for honey.
