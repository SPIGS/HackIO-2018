# DECSing - (HackIO-2018 Project)

## Description:
DECSing is a Java program that reads the bit information from MIDI music files (a file type commonly used for karaoke machines and music production) and translates it into pitch, phoneme, and tone information so it can be sung by the DECTalk text-to-speech program.
